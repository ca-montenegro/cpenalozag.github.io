# My Personal Web Page

Personal web page developed for my web development course. Check it out [here](https://cpenalozag.github.io/).

It is a simple presentation website made using:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

In the web page you can find information about my interests, projects, skills and experience.
